# phisCapsArt
WoW addon which changes the action bar cap arts on a per character basis. (Inspired by the original addons from SAM, ganders and Imithat)

## Usage
The addon automatically changes the action bar cap art either to a default or a character specific texture so there is nothing you have to do.

## File Description
- **phisCapsArt.lua** contains the main code
- **phisCapsArt.toc** is the standard WoW table-of-contents file containing addon information
- **phisCapsArt_textures.lua** contains tables to assign faction IDs to corresponding tabards and zones
- **images/** contains various textures which replace the vanilla action bar caps

## Changes
- **0.9**: Initial upload
